# Mindful X Blocker

Mindful X Blocker is a Chrome extension that intercepts X / Twitter and walks you through a gentle, intention-setting pause before you step back into the site. The experience combines reflective prompts, inline breathing and stretching flows, hydration reminders, a calm music player, and supportive alternatives so you only unlock X when you have a clear purpose and time limit.

## Features

- **Mindful gate:** Redirects every X/Twitter visit to an intervention screen that captures your purpose and a 1–120 minute focus window.
- **Inline alternatives:** Activity cards open mindful panels in-place—uplifting music, breathing animation, two-minute stretch, hydration timer, mindful walk resources, and a calming call flow.
- **Session enforcement:** Background worker stores the active timer, syncs alarms, and closes all X/Twitter tabs when time expires.
- **Persistent tone:** Calming palette, soft animations, and supportive copy drawn from the project PRD and mindful design guidelines.

```

## Getting started

1. Install dependencies once if you plan to regenerate icons:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Load the extension in Chrome:
   1. Visit `chrome://extensions` and enable **Developer mode**.
   2. Click **Load unpacked** and select the project root.
   3. Navigate to `https://x.com` to trigger the intervention.

## Building a release ZIP

Chrome doesnt require a build step; zip everything that ships with the extension:

```bash
zip -r mindful-x-blocker.zip \
  manifest.json background.js content intervention icons scripts \
  package.json package-lock.json
```

Upload that ZIP to the Chrome Web Store Developer Dashboard when you publish updates. Remember to bump the `version` field in `manifest.json` before each upload.

## Chrome Web Store checklist

- Register a developer account (one-time $5 fee).
- Prepare assets: 128 icon (already included), 9208 banner, three 1280720 screenshots or short clips of the mindful panels.
- Draft a privacy statement clarifying that data stays local to `chrome.storage.local`.
- Submit the packaged ZIP and complete the store listing with calm, supportive copy.

## Documentation & changelog policy

Internal working docs (`README.md`, `Changelog.md`, PRD, folder READMEs, etc.) remain local and are ignored in version control. `FINAL-README.md` is the single source of public-facing documentation committed to GitHub.

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome. Please:

1. Follow the mindful tone and UI palette described above.
2. Update inline activity panels and background logic together.
3. Manually verify key flows (intervention redirect, timer overlay, alarms) since automated tests are not configured.
4. Update the local changelog even though it stays untracked.
