# MindfulX User Guide

**Version 0.1.0**

MindfulX is a Chrome extension that helps you use X (Twitter) more intentionally by introducing a mindful reflection pause before each visit.

---

## How It Works

### 1. Before You Visit X/Twitter

When you navigate to X.com or Twitter.com, MindfulX shows an intervention page asking:

- **What are you here for?** - State your specific purpose
- **How long do you need?** - Set a time limit (1-120 minutes)

You can also choose from 6 alternative mindful activities instead of browsing X.

### 2. During Your Session

Once you start a session:
- Access X/Twitter normally
- See a timer in the bottom-right corner showing remaining time
- Timer changes color as time runs low:
  - **Green** - More than 5 minutes remaining
  - **Yellow** - 2-5 minutes remaining
  - **Red** - Less than 2 minutes remaining

### 3. When Time's Up

When your session expires:
- A modal appears reminding you that time is up
- See your original purpose statement
- Choose to either:
  - Close X and return to other priorities
  - Request 5 additional minutes

## Usage Tips

### Set Specific Intentions
Instead of: "Check social media"
Try: "Share product launch announcement and respond to customer questions"

### Be Realistic with Time
- Start with shorter sessions (15-30 minutes)
- You can always request more time if needed
- Better to underestimate than overestimate

### Use Alternatives When Distracted
If you find yourself visiting X out of habit rather than intention, try one of the alternative activities instead.

### Review Your Purpose
When the "Time's Up" modal appears, ask yourself:
- Did I accomplish what I came here to do?
- Did I stay focused on my original purpose?
- Am I ready to move on to other priorities?

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can I use this on mobile Chrome?**
A: No, Chrome extensions only work on desktop browsers (Windows, Mac, Linux, Chromebook).

**Q: Does this work on other social media sites?**
A: Currently MindfulX only works on X (Twitter). Future versions may support additional platforms.

**Q: What happens if I close Chrome during a session?**
A: Your session ends when Chrome closes. You'll need to set a new intention next time you visit X.

**Q: Can I disable the extension temporarily?**
A: Yes, go to `chrome://extensions/` and toggle MindfulX off. Remember to re-enable it when you want to use it again.

**Q: Does this completely block X/Twitter?**
A: No. MindfulX encourages intentional use by requiring you to state a purpose and time limit, but it doesn't prevent access entirely.

**Q: Can I change my purpose or time limit mid-session?**
A: Not currently. If you need to adjust, you can close all X tabs and start a new session with updated intentions.

**Q: Is my browsing history tracked?**
A: Absolutely not. MindfulX only monitors when you visit X/Twitter to show the intervention. It doesn't track, collect, or store any browsing history.
